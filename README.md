# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

Bookbot is a CLI python program that takes a sys.argv argument, entered as a relative directory path (/books/xyz.txt), 
that will analyze and return both the number of words, as well as each individual alphanumeric character's count. 

Will work with any text file, but written with books in mind.
